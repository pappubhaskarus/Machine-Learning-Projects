    "To build this, you can take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an app that can take in a live video feed.\n",
    "    Use Python’s face recognition API to detect faces and emotions on objects in the video feed.\n",
    "    After classifying these emotions into various categories, start building the recommender system. This can be a set of hardcoded values for each emotion, which means you don’t need to involve machine learning for the recommendations.\n",
    "    Once you’re done building the app, you can deploy it on Heroku, Dash, or a web server.\n",
